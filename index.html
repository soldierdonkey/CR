    The equation of Cellular Respiration is:  Glucose + 6O<sub>2</sub> = 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + LOTS OF ATP (up to 38) <br><br>
    In Cellular Respiration, glucose is broken down to create energy in the form of ATP. This lengthy process must occur, because glucose is'nt like a car battery that you plug into your meatgrinder, it's more like a puddle of deisel, that needs a generator to be used.<br><br>
    When looking at the two equations, Photosynthesis, and Cellular Respiration, they look very similar, except reversed. Even some of the processes in Cellular Respiration look like Photosynthesis played in reverse.<br><br>
    The structure of the Mitochondria supports the later parts of Cellular Respiration that take place in it by creation a semi-permeable membrane for the ATP synthase, and creating an aerobic environment for the Link reaction and the Krebs Cycle.<br><br>
